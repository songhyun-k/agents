## Model Configuration

Agents are assigned to specific Claude models based on task complexity and computational requirements. The ecosystem uses a three-tier model strategy optimized for quality and performance.

### Model Distribution Summary

| Model | Agent Count | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Opus | ~60 | Complex reasoning, architecture, language expertise, security, AI/ML |
| Sonnet | ~10 | Balanced performance for specialized tasks |
| Haiku | ~30 | Fast execution: SEO optimization, documentation, deployment, debugging |

### Model Selection Criteria

#### Opus - Complex Reasoning & Architecture

**Use when:**
- Designing system architecture and making technology decisions
- Performing security audits and code reviews
- Providing programming language expertise (all language-pro agents)
- Creating complex AI/ML pipelines
- Handling business-critical analysis (financial, legal, HR)
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Building frontend/mobile applications with modern patterns

#### Sonnet - Balanced Performance

**Use when:**
- Tasks requiring good reasoning with moderate latency
- Specialized domain tasks not requiring maximum capability
- Balanced cost-performance scenarios

#### Haiku - Fast Execution & Deterministic Tasks

**Use when:**
- Generating documentation from templates
- Executing infrastructure operations and deployments
- Performing database query optimization
- Handling SEO optimization tasks (meta tags, keywords)
- Managing deployment pipelines
- Quick debugging and error detection
- Customer support responses

### Hybrid Orchestration Patterns

The plugin ecosystem leverages Opus + Haiku orchestration for optimal quality and performance:

#### Pattern 1: Planning → Execution
```
Opus: backend-architect (design API architecture)
  ↓
Opus: Generate API endpoints with best practices
  ↓
Haiku: test-automator (generate comprehensive tests)
  ↓
Opus: code-reviewer (architectural review)
```

#### Pattern 2: Reasoning → Action (Incident Response)
```
Opus: incident-responder (diagnose issue, create strategy)
  ↓
Haiku: devops-troubleshooter (execute fixes)
  ↓
Haiku: deployment-engineer (deploy hotfix)
  ↓
Haiku: Implement monitoring alerts
```

#### Pattern 3: Complex → Simple (Database Design)
```
Opus: database-architect (schema design, technology selection)
  ↓
Haiku: sql-pro (generate migration scripts)
  ↓
Haiku: database-admin (execute migrations)
  ↓
Haiku: database-optimizer (tune query performance)
```

#### Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Workflows
```
Full-Stack Feature Development:
Opus: backend-architect + frontend-developer (design components)
  ↓
Opus: Generate code following designs
  ↓
Haiku: test-automator (unit + integration tests)
  ↓
Opus: security-auditor (security review)
  ↓
Haiku: deployment-engineer (CI/CD setup)
  ↓
Haiku: Setup observability stack
```

## Agent Invocation

### Natural Language

Agents can be invoked through natural language when you need Claude to reason about which specialist to use:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

### Slash Commands

Many agents are accessible through plugin slash commands for direct invocation:

```bash
/backend-development:feature-development user authentication
/security-scanning:security-sast
/incident-response:smart-fix "memory leak in payment service"
```

## Contributing

To add a new agent:

1. Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/agents/{agent-name}.md`
2. Add frontmatter with name, description, and model assignment
3. Write comprehensive system prompt
4. Update plugin definition in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

See [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
